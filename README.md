# Go Horsey, Go Run!
> Concurrent Rust CLI horse run. Mini Rust game for my programming languages class.
> - ***created by Pride***

A mini game that involves Rust concurrency and multithreading to simulate horse racing gambles. Uses `Arc` and `Mutex<bool>`
to manage data racing of the resource that announces the winner. Uses `rand` to do some RNG of horse paces to update their position 
in each thread.
